# Business Rules

## Paid vs. Free Decision Guidelines
**In General, any activity in the Product that consumes paid compute resources shall be available only to Paid Users.**

### Cost-Controlled Features
* Generate AI Description of Item (currently only commoner NPCs)
* Add new Items to Cloud Storage

### "Free" Features
* View / Filter lists of previously saved Items, View Items
* Random Generation of items
* Export / Download previously saved Items  (once this capability exists)
* Edit / Delete previously created Items (MAYBE???)
* Future features that do not require Paid Resources.

## Subscription Guidelines

* All users with a Login & Profile will have access to the "Free" Features for as long as The Product exists.
* There will be no Trial or Free period for the Paid Features.
* Initially, we will offer a single Tier of Paid Subscription.
  * The subscription period will be 30 days, exact billing schedule details are managed by the E-Commerce Service.
* When a Customer Discontinues their Subscription, they will retain access to the Paid services through the last day of their currently paid period.  After that date passes, the Customer will become a Free customer, and have access only to those Features.
* When a Customer CANCELS their subscription, they will receive a pro-rated refund based on how many days they have remaining in their current billing period, and revert to a Free Customer status immediately.
  * May need to impose a fee on this to cover transaction costs with the E-Commerce Service.
* A customer can PAUSE their Paid subscription.
  * Consider limiting how many times a subscription can be paused during a year's period.  (Trailing, perhaps?)
  * Consider limiting the LENGTH of this pause to less than a full billing period.
  * During the time a subscription is Paused, the Customer can access the Free features.
  * When the Subscription resumes, access to the Paid features is restored, and the next billing date is calculated from RestoreDate + Days Remaining when the subscription was paused.


## Brainstormed Ideas
* Consider exporting a small handful of NPCs that I've generated for my own purposes, (and later, other Game World Items) in a monthly newsletter to anyone in the User list who is not a current subscriber.
* PERHAPS compile a digest of NPCs and other World Items that I've created during my own usage into a yearly PDF for sale as a one-time purchase???  Hmmm... (Sell the Gravy)
